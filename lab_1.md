# Lab 1 

## Objectives

- Review and reflection on Normalization processes
- Empirical comparison of top-down and bottom-up approach to normalization

## Exercise

1. Perform normalization on the following scenario:
	
	1.1 First do it with bottom-up approach
	
	1.2 Then, do it with top-down approach

2. Do we come up with same normalized tables from both the methods? Discuss any possible reasons.

3. Which one is the correct solution for this scenario? Why?

4. What could have been done differently to come up with same solution from both normalization processes?
